<h3><img src="wee.png" align="bottom" />Updated ui_gtk.e</h3>
<hr />

<p>
This file is updated to use the latest EuGTK 4.15 functions, to replace 
the older version of ui_gtk.e shipped with WEE. It adds some
icons to the menus as well.
</p>

<p>
Because WEE is specifically a Euphoria code editor, there's no need for fancy
fonts, so I have filtered out all but mono-space fonts. Also, since WEE has options
to color-code and emphasize (bold) keywords, I do not show bold or italic versions
of the fonts in the font-selector. Those would conflict with the keyword bolding.
</p>

<h5>To Install:</h5>
<p>
<pre>
Copy ui_gtk.e into ~/WEE-master
Copy eu.cfg into ~/WEE-master 
</pre>

Delete the eugtk folder in WEE-master.
Be sure to add a eu.cfg to the WEE-master folder pointing to your EuGTK runtime
 (by default, this would be ~/demos).
</p>

<p>
As with all EuGTK programs, eu.cfg should  reflect the location of your current GtkEngine.e, GtkEnums.e, 
etc...
</p>

<p>
Also included here is a WEE icon, for use if you want to make a link to WEE on your Desktop.</p>
