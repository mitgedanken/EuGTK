`<span font='bold 16'>GtkPlacesSidebar</span>

GtkPlacesSidebar is a widget that displays a list of frequently-used places in the file system: 
the user's home directory, the user's bookmarks, and volumes and drives. 

This widget is used as a sidebar in GtkFileChooser and may be used by file managers and 
similar programs.

The places sidebar displays drives and volumes, and will automatically mount or unmount them 
when the user selects them.

Applications can hook to various signals in the places sidebar to customize its behavior. 
For example, they can add extra commands to the context menu of the sidebar.

While bookmarks are completely in control of the user, the places sidebar also allows individual 
applications to provide extra shortcut folders that are unique to each application. 

For example, a Paint program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. 
You can do this with gtk_places_sidebar_add_shortcut(). 

Click the Add button below to choose a folder and add it to the sidebar.
