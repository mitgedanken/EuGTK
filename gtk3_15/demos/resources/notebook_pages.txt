Title = Bird;
Image = thumbnails/thunderbird.png;
Text = This is the mythical <b>Thunderbird</b>,
placed on the tops of totem poles by 
Native Americans in order to receive
e-mails from distant tribes.

<small><i>(I learned this on the Internet)</i></small>

Title=Ladybug; -- a small insect;
Image=thumbnails/bug-buddy.png;
Text=<span font='URW Chancery L 18'><b>The Ladybug</b></span>
A harmless and colorfully-dressed, 
if not always stylish, little insect 

Title=Dragon;
Image=thumbnails/dragon.png;
Text=<b>Dragons</b> are mythical beasts, 
<u><i>but not as mythical as an honest politician</i></u>...

Title=Elephant;
Image=thumbnails/mouse.png;
Text=<b><i><s>Elephant</s></i></b>
     I guess this isn't an elephant,
     (I didn't have a picture of an elephant)
     but it's <u>just like</u> an elephant:
     it is round, has big ears, and a thin tail...

Title=Fox;
Image=thumbnails/fox.png;
Text=<b>The Fox</b>
  A fox is smarter than a dog
   <small> (because it doesn't take orders from people)</small>
  and more clever than a coyote
   <small> (because it never wastes money on <i><b>Acme</b></i> products)</small>

Some garbage text here,
which should never show up, since it is not keyed.

Title=Mongoose;
Image=thumbnails/mongoose.png;
Text=<b>Mongoose</b>
Not really a goose at all, it is the 
<a href='http://OpenEuphoria.org'> OpenEuphoria </a>'mascot'.
<small>
(I guess its eyes are red from programming all night.)</small>
