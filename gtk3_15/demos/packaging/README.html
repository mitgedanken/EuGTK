<hr /><h3 class='blue'>Packaging your EuGTK programs<hr /></h3>

<p><i>Instructions below are specific to Linux; Windows&trade; users are on their own.</i></p>

<p>
The are several methods by which your program can be launched:
</p>

<ul>
<li> from a terminal in your home directory:
<div class="scrn"><tt>user@user-desktop ~ $ <em class="orange">eui demos/test0</em></tt></div></li>
<li>from a terminal in your program's directory:
<div class="scrn"><tt>user@user-desktop ~ $ <em class="orange">cd demos</em><br />user@user-desktop ~/demos $ <em class="orange">eui test0</em></tt></div></li>
<li>or by clicking a program icon
from your window manager.</li>
</ul>

<p> 
This can make it difficult for your program to find where images
are located. This in turn makes it difficult to package programs and images
in such a way that they can be moved anywhere within the file system
the user desires. 
</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>
In order for your program to find associated images, you can package the images
in the same folder as your program.
</p>

<p>
Then, immediately after including GtkEngine.e, add:<pre>  <code><em class="kw">if not equal</em>(prog_dir,curr_dir) <em class="kw">then</em> 
     <em class="kw">chdir</em>(prog_dir) 
  <em class="kw">end if</em>
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
If you're coding manually, this is usually all it takes to make the package 
moveable.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this scheme depends upon changing to the program directory before
loading the images. After that, you can change to another directory
if appropriate for your work, as long as you don't need to load any images
later in the program (such as from a pop-up dialog).
</p>

<p>
It may be a good idea to change back to the original directory after loading 
the images:<pre>  <code><em class="kw">chdir</em>(init_dir)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this does not work with Glade. You're pretty much stuck
with storing the images in the same folder as the source code. It may be
preferable to convert the images into Euphoria include files.
</p>

<h3>Buttons</h3>

<p><i>
Info below applies <i>only</i> to icons used with buttons, not to images
used as GdkPixbufs or GtkImages.
</i></p>

<p>
If you need to supply custom button icons with your program, you do not
need to 'hard-code' the location of those icons, but can instead 
append the location of those icons (obtained at run-time) to the icon theme.
</p>

<p>
The icons <i>must</i> be .png files, but you do <i>not</i> include the 
extension when creating buttons from these icon files.
</p>

<p>
Use this if icons are located in the same folder as the program:

<p><code><pre>
<em class="kw">constant</em> theme = <em class="gtk">create</em>(GtkIconTheme) 
<em class="gtk">set</em>(theme,<em class="str">"append search path"</em>,prog_dir) 
</pre></code></p>
</p>

<p>
If icons are located in a subdirectory of the program (e.g. thumbnails):

<p><code><pre>
<em class="kw">constant</em> theme = <em class="gtk">create</em>(GtkIconTheme) 
<em class="gtk">set</em>(theme,<em class="str">"append search path"</em>,prog_dir & <em class="str">"/thumbnails"</em>) 
</pre></code></p>
</p>

<p>
In either of the above, if the program directory is moved, the associated icons you supplied will move with it.
Also, it's easy to 'zip' up the whole thing for distribution.
</p>

<p>
For Linux, it's possible to create a hidden <i>.config/your_program</i> folder, and store
the button icons as .png files and .ini files there. See <a href="../test231.ex">test231</a>.
</p>

<p><code><pre>
<em class="kw">constant</em> theme = <em class="gtk">create</em>(GtkIconTheme)
<em class="gtk">set</em>(theme,<em class="str">"append search path"</em>,<em class="kw">canonical_path</em>(<em class="str">"~/.config/your_program"</em>))
</pre></code></p>
</p>

<p>
Remember, this only works for icons (buttons, etc) not images, and 
only looks for .png images, so it's of limited utility.
Unfortunately, it also requires you to <i><b>not</b></i> use the .png extension
when coding the button. I can't recommend this, really. It's too much 
trouble for too little gain.
</p>

<hr />

<h4>For those who wear both suspenders and a belt...</h4>

<p>
The best advice I can give to eliminate all problems is to hand-code your 
program rather than use Glade, and to convert all images to .xpm and then
include them as *.e files. Use the utility xpm_to_eu_include.ex program.
Then bind or compile it. That way, your images will always go with the program, 
and can never get lost, changed, or deleted.
