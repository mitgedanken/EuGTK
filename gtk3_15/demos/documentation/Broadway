launchpad.net GTK+3 with the Broadway (HTML5) backend : Nicolas Delvaux 

This is a rebuild of the GTK+3 Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 13.04, 13.10, 14.04 and 14.10 packages with an enabled Broadway backend.
Note that this PPA is no longer necessary starting from Ubuntu 15.04, as the Broadway backend is now enabled by default. 
The main difference with this PPA is that the "broadwayd" binary is shipped in the "libgtk-3-bin" package when it was in 
a separated "broadwayd" package in the PPA.

ADDING THIS PPA TO YOUR SYSTEM
 ==============================
Run these commands in a terminal:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:malizor/gtk-broadway
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get upgrade
 sudo apt-get install broadwayd # For Ubuntu >= 13.10
 
HOWTO SINCE SAUCY (gtk+ >= 3.8)
===============================
As an example, here is how to run gedit in your browser.

In a terminal, run:
 broadwayd
 
In another terminal, run:
 GDK_BACKEND=broadway UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 eui test0.ex
 
Finally, open you Web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/
The "UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0" is only useful if you use the global-menu and/or overlay-scrollbars. You have to disable them for Broadway, otherwise the program will segfault.
Please see the "broadwayd" manpage for more information.

HOWTO BEFORE SAUCY (gtk+ < 3.8)
 ===============================
As an example, here is how to run gedit in your browser.
In a terminal, run:
 GDK_BACKEND=broadway UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 gedit
Finally, open you Web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/
The "UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0" is only useful if you use the global-menu and/or overlay-scrollbars. You have to disable them for Broadway, otherwise the program will segfault.
You can customize the port by setting the BROADWAY_DISPLAY variable.

DISCLAIMER
 ==========
I provide this PPA in the hope that it will be useful and I will try to upload new versions whenever the Ubuntu package is updated.
 However, I do NOT guarantee that this PPA will always be stable and up-to-date nor that packages it contains may not destroy your computer, cause the end of the world and kill kittens. AaCharis SIL CompactAaClear Sans AAAAA DarkLightAuto
