<p>
<b>EuGTK is native for Linux</b><br />
Most modern Linux distros come with GTK3 already installed. If not, you can usually 
install the GTK3 libraries easily with your package manager (apt-get or similar).
No special setup or configuration steps are involved.
</p>

<p>
<b>EuGTK is also reported to work with OS X&trade;</b>. First, install MacPorts, and 
then the GTK3 library with this command: 
<code>sudo port install gtk3</code>
That should eventually install the library to /opt/local/lib/libgtk-3.dylib.
 I cannot test this, since I have no computer running OSX, but Pete Eberlein's
 cross-platform Euphoria editor WEE runs on OS X using EuGTK for the user interface. 
 That's a pretty good test.
</p>

<p>
<b>EuGTK also now works well with Windows&trade;</b>, but only for 64-bit systems. 32-bit 
Windows libraries are no longer being updated.
</p>

<p>
<b>Raspberry Pi 3</b> - the Raspbian OS comes with GTK3 and EuGTK programs run
even on such limited hardware. Binding your programs makes them run quickly, startup  
is slow unless bound, shrouded, or compiled.
</p>

<p><b>EuGTK programs can be run on <i>any</i> platform.</b><br /><br />
You can even run EuGTK programs on a remote client (anything that has an HTML5 web 
browser, including tablets, phones, etc.), by using broadway on the server. 
<u>Clients do not need EuGTK, Euphoria, or GTK to be installed.</u>
</p>

<p>
The Broadway server can be downloaded using apt-get, or your package manager, 
and it also comes stock with the latest Mint 18, and perhaps some other distros as well.
</p>

<p>
This is still experimental, but most of the demos in this package work ok 
with a web browser. (Even the complex <a href="../BEAR.ex">BEAR</a>).
Many work when browsing with a tablet or phone. Probably my 
demo programs need to listen for 'motion' events (swipes, etc) to get these 
working fully, or perhaps the browsers on my tablet aren't up-to-date with HTML5?
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../on_broadway.ex">on_broadway.ex</a> utility can be used to launch 
a Euphoria program and open your default web browser to localhost:8080. You can also
specify a different port on the command line.
</p>

<p>
Multiple users are not currently supported, but you can run several instances of the broadwayd server, 
assigning a different port for each.
