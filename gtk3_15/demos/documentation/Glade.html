<h3><hr />Overview<hr /></h3>

<p>
It is now possible to use <a href="http://glade.gnome.org">Glade</a> to design your EuGTK 
program interface. I've tested with Glade version 3.18.3.
You will still have to write snippets of code in Euphoria to handle 
user events - just as you would when using Visual Basic&trade;, Delphi&trade;, etc.,
- except that the snippets in Euphoria will likely be <i>much</i> simpler and
easier to understand! 
</p>

<p>Bear in mind, however, that the most-complex program in this EuGTK package 
is the <a href="bear.html">BEAR</a>, and I did <i>not</i> use Glade to design it. It was much 
easier to get the look I wanted by simply hand-coding everything!
</p>

<p>Begin by reading <a href="../glade/StartingGlade.html">Starting Glade I and II</a> for an 
introduction, then read the rest of this page for details.
</p>

<p>
Glade has a preview button so that you can see, to a limited extent, what your program 
will look like. Controls won't be linked (can't respond to user interaction) until you 
load the glade XML into your Euphoria program and provide the 'handler' functions. 
Often, these handler functions will only require a few lines of code.
</p>

<p>
EuGTK will try to help you with this task by supplying a ready-made template
for undeclared functions, which you copy and paste into your Euphoria code using whatever 
text editor you prefer.
</p>

<p>This template will appear on the terminal from which you run your 
program. See the screenshot below.
</p>
<a href="../screenshots/template.png">
<img src="../screenshots/template.png" alt="template" clear="left" align="right" width="400px" />
</a>
<p>You <b><i>must</i></b> run programs from a terminal (x-term, for example) while
developing and testing. There's no way around this.
</p>

<p>
Your program begins as usual:<br />

<code>
<pre> <em class="kw">include</em> GtkEngine.e</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>
Next, you tell EuGTK's built-in <i>builder</i> object 
to load your program's XML description from the file created by Glade. The builder will 
try to connect any signals for which you have declared a handler 
(in the Glade Properties-&gt;Signals tabs). Finally, you call main() to start the GTK 
processing loop.
<div class="quote"><tt><pre>
<em class="kw">include</em> GtkEngine.e
<em class="gtk">add</em>(builder,<em class="str">"list.glade"</em>)
<em class="gtk">main()</em><pre></tt></div>
</p>

<p>With just those three lines of code, you are now ready to run your program!<br /><br />
Of course, it won't do anything, except perhaps spit out a message telling you that
you haven't bothered to write handlers for events declared in Glade.
</p>

<p>
You should run the program (preferably from WEE with terminal, Geany using
 gneui.ex, or directly from an x-term).
EuGTK will prompt you with an error message and hopefully an empty function template for the 
missing function.
You can copy and paste that into your editor, and then fill in the body of the function.
Put these functions after the call to main().
</p>

<div class="hint boxshadow">
<img class="hint" src="../thumbnails/hint.png" alt="hint" width="100px" align="left" float="right" />
<p>
When using Glade, your Euphoria code may use string identifiers to refer to 
objects, rather than having to obtain a pointer (a.k.a. 'handle') to them first.
</p>

<p class="L20R">
Glade will assign a unique identifier for widgets (which it calls the <b>ID:</b>). 
The ID will be something like 'checkbutton1', 'checkbutton2', 'radiobutton1', etc.
</p>

<p class="L20R"> This ID property is found on the General tab of the Properties dialog.
You may change the IDs if you wish, sometimes changing them can make your code easier to 
understand.
</p>

<p class="L20R">
Obviously, you should avoid naming two controls with the same name.
</p>

<p class="L20R">
If you are using <u>multiple</u> Glade files, you will almost certainly have more than 
one 'button1', etc. but this isn't a problem, because a namespace will be prepended. 
See <a href="#namespaces"> namespaces </a>below.
</p>
</div>

<br clear="all" />

<a name="namespaces" />

<h3><hr />Namespaces<hr /></h3>
<p>When writing a large program with multiple windows, Glade can become difficult to 
navigate safely. Click on the wrong thing in Glade, and you may lose all your work. 
This isn't good, so you should try to break your program into small, safe 'modules', 
each with its own Euphoria include (.e) file and corresponding Glade (.glade) file.
</p>

<p>
Let's say, for example, I'm going to need a 'main' window, a pop-up 'edit' window, and 
the usual "About..." dialog.
I'd create three Glade files, one named main.glade, the second edit.glade, and the third 
about.glade. 
After laying out these three windows using Glade, it's very likely that Glade will 
have used identical names for controls in the files. 'button1', for example, might appear 
in all three. You could, if you wish, wade thru all your Glade files and rename these as
necessary to prevent conflicts, but
EuGTK offers a less labor-intensive way:
</p>

<p>
EuGTK namespacing allows you to refer to these controls by name in a manner familiar to 
Euphoria programmers:
<ul>
<li><em class="str">"button1"</em> ~ button1 in main.ex</li>
<li><em class="str">"edit:button1"</em> ~ button1 in edit.e</li>
<li><em class="str">"about:button1"</em> ~ button1 in about.e</li>
</ul> 

Example:
<code><pre>	<em class="gtk">set</em>(<em class="str"><b>"edit:window1"</b>,"background","blue"</em>)
</pre></code>
Note that these are strings. If you wish to convert them to pointers (handles), you can use the pointer() function:
<pre><code>	<em class="kw">constant</em> win1 = <em class="gtk">pointer</em>(<em class="str"><b>"edit:window1"</b></em>)
</code></pre>
Other files can now access the edit.e window in the normal Euphoria way:
<pre><code>	<em class="gtk">set</em>(win1,<em class="str">"background"</em>,...)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>There seems to be no noticeable delay when accessing controls via the string names. 
In a test which read and set label text using the handle to the label stored in a constant, 20,000
iterations per second were reported. When using the label's name in string form, 18,900 per second 
were reported. </p>

<p>
To keep things neatly organized, you should put your Eu code in separate files as well: 
main.ex, edit.e, and about.e.
</p>

<p>
Your Eu file main.ex would then include the line:
<pre><code>	<em class="gtk">add</em>(builder,<em class="str">"main.glade"</em>)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>And your edit.e include file would have the lines:
<div class="quote"><tt><pre>
<em class="kw">namespace</em> edit
<em class="kw">include</em> GtkEngine.e
<em class="gtk">add</em>(builder,<em class="str">"edit.glade"</em>)
</pre></tt></div>
</p>

<h4><hr />Namespaced names
<a href="../screenshots/namespaces.png" title="Click for a larger view" >
<img src="../screenshots/namespaces.png" width="300px" align="right" />
</a></h4>


<p>
To examine the namespaced names as loaded by EuGTK, add the line 
<b><code> with define BUILDER </code></b>
to your main program prior to including GtkEngine.e,
or add <b><code>-d BUILDER</code></b> to the command-line.
The namespaced names will be shown on the xterm when you run your program. 
</p>
 
 <p> 
 EuGTK refers to widgets created by Glade by their ID. For example, the main window 
 of a program created by Glade would have the default ID of "window1", and your EuGTK 
 program would access that window as "window1". 
 These ID's are assigned automatically by Glade, but can be changed if you wish.
 </p>

<p>
The GLADE ID names are those you use to refer to the widgets in your
Euphoria program: <em class="str">"prefs:window1"</em>, for example.
</p>

<p>Note that the HANDLE is only useful for internal debugging purposes.
It changes with every run.
</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Widget names</b>

<a href="../screenshots/namespaces2.png" title="click for a larger view" >
<img src="../screenshots/namespaces2.png" align="right" width="300px" />
</a>

<p>
Confusingly, Glade also has a <i>Widget name:</i> property, blank by default,
which is found under the Common tab.
You should avoid using this except under special circumstances. It isn't normally
 needed.
 </p>

<p> 
There are a few 'trick' uses for this 'Widget name' property, however:<br />
<p>One possible use is to pass data to a Euphoria function. 
For example, you might have a set of radio buttons which all call a single handler 
function. That function could examine the control's 'Widget name' to determine what to do. 
If, for example, the buttons select various colors, each button could have a different 
color as the name property: 'red', 'green', or 'blue', etc.
<br />
See <a href="../glade/widgetname.ex">widgetname.ex</a> and 
<a href="../glade/widgetname.glade">widgetname.glade</a>.
</p>

<p>A more complex use might be to pass function names to a central 'dispatch' function,  
which could then call the desired function by converting the 'name' into a routine_id. 
</p>

<hr />
<p><b>Cautions</b><br /><br />
The XML file created by Glade automatically includes a "requires..." line, specifying 
a minimum GTK version. You may find it helpful to remove that line under certain conditions, 
for example when designing your program on a computer with a current version of GTK/Glade, 
but running it on a computer with an earlier version. 
Just use a plain-text editor to zap the offending line.
</p>

<a name="problems" />

<h3><hr />Common Problems<hr /></h3>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>I run my program without errors but <i>can't see anything!</i><br />
    <dfn>
    You <em><u>must</u></em> click on the <i>'visible'</i> property checkbox for your main window.
    This is found on the 'Common' tab under 'Widget Flags'.<br />
    <i></i><b>Oh, and while you're there,</b></i> be sure to link the main window's <i>destroy</i>
    signal to the built-in function Quit, so that your program will clean up after itself when finished!
    You must do these two things for the main window of every program you write.</dfn>
    </li>

    <li>I put buttons in a dialog, such as FileChooserDialog, but they don't do anything!<br />
    <dfn>Set a unique <i>'Response ID'</i> for each button.
    This is found on the 'General' tab under 'Button Attributes'.<br />
    This ID is returned when the dialog closes as a result of a button being clicked.
    </dfn>
    </li>

    <li>How do I make menu items work like check menu items or radio menu items?<br />
    <dfn>
    I don't know how to do that using Glade.
    You'll have to write code in Euphoria, or &lt;gasp!&gt; try to edit the .glade xml directly.
    </dfn>
    </li>

    <li>I want to use widget x, but can't find it on the Glade palette<br />
    <dfn>
    Some things are hard to find, and some just aren't there.
    New GTK widgets introduced since GTK 3.10 are partially missing.
    If you're working on the 'bleeding edge' of GTK3, you probably should be 
    coding by hand.
    </dfn>
    </li>

    <li>How should I name the function that responds to a signal?<br />
    <dfn>
    If you click on the widget's Signals tab, you'll see a list of signals that can be linked.<br /> 
    For example, a button has a 'clicked' signal.
    You then click on the &lt;type here&gt; space adjacent to the signal name, and press the 'o' key. 
    <em>that's the letter o, not a zero!</em><br />
    When you do, a suggested function handler name will be plugged in.
    You can, of course, type in any global function name you prefer here.
    For example, the handler name for a Quit or Exit button should usually be <em class="black">Quit</em>
    (no quotes). This will call EuGTK's built-in Quit() function when the button is clicked.
    </dfn>
    </li>
    
    <li>I want to write <i>one</i> Eu function to handle multiple controls.<br />
    <dfn>
    Instead of accepting the default handler name, supply your own
    For example, if you have 3 buttons, Glade will supply handler names:
    <ul><li>on_button1_clicked</li><li>on_button2_clicked</li><li>on_button3_clicked</li></ul>
    You simply remove the 1, 2, and 3 from the handler names, and name your Eu function
    <em class="black">on_button_clicked</em>. All 3 buttons will call that function.
    It's then your job to sort them out.
    </dfn>
    </li>
    
</ol>

</p>

<a name="compile" />
<h3><hr />Compiling, Binding, etc...<hr /></h3>
<p><em>Caution!</em></p>

<p>
As usual, you can compile, bind, or shroud your Eu program. If you do any of these, your program 
will <i>still</i> try to load the GUI description from the Glade XML file at run-time. This could be either good or bad, depending upon your perspective.
</p>

<p>
<u>The benefits:</u>
<ul>
    <li>The GUI appearance can be adjusted without messing with the program logic.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<u>The drawbacks:</u>
<ul>
    <li>Anyone can easily trash your nice program by changing names or removing controls in the .glade file.
    </li>
    <li>The .glade file must be distributed along with the .ex file.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="hint boxshadow" style="width:80%;" >
<img class="hint" src="../thumbnails/hint.png" width="100px" alt="hint" align="left" float="right" />
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<b>Knowing the way some users think...</b><br />
It's almost certain that someone will see that Glade&trade;<sup><em>*</em></sup> file,<br />
think <i>"I don't care about air fresheners.."</i> and delete it.
<br /><br />
<small><i><sup><em>*</em></sup> brand name for a common type of room deodorizer spray in the U.S.</i></small>
</p>

</div>

<p>
One easy solution to this problem is to copy the XML from the Glade file, paste it into a new file,
enclose it in triple quotes, and assign it to an exported constant. Below, the added code is in red, while the XML produced by Glade is shown in black:
<code><pre><em>  namespace widgets
  export constant XML = """</em>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
    &lt;!-- Generated with glade 3.16.1 --&gt;
    &lt;interface&gt;
    &lt;requires lib="gtk+" version="3.10"/&gt;
    ---etc---
  <em>"""</em>
</pre></code></p>
<p>

Save this new file as an include: call it widgets.e, to match the namespace, and then your code becomes:
<code><pre>
    <em class="kw">include</em> GtkEngine.e
    <em class="kw">include</em> widgets.e
    <em class="gtk">add</em>(builder,widgets:XML)
    <em class="gtk">main()</em>
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
Now you can bind, shroud or compile your program and the interface will be 'hard coded' into it. Changing or deleting 
the widgets.xml or widgets.glade files will make no difference. No changes to your program interface can be made
without re-compiling or re-binding. If you wish to leave your users
with <i>some</i> measure of customizability, but without the ability to 
completely trash your program, use this method along with an ini.
