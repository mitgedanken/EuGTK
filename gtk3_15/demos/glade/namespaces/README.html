<h2>Glade Demo</h2>
<hr />

<p>
The files in this folder demonstrate one way to build a program using
Glade. This scheme is suitable for more-complex programs which need to be
split up into 'modules' for easier maintenance.
</p>

<p>
There will be two files associated with each window or dialog, one
containing the Glade xml, which describes the user interface, and one 
containing the Euphoria code which responds to user events assocated
with that window or dialog.
</p>

<p>
This simple program consists of:
<ul>
<li>A Main window
	<dd><a href="main.glade">main.glade</a></dd></li>
<li>An About dialog
	<dd><a href="about.glade">about.glade</a></dd>
	<dd><a href="about.e">about.e</a></dd></li>
<li>A File dialog
	<dd><a href="file.glade">file.glade</a></dd>
	<dd><a href="file.e">file.e</a></dd></li>
<li>A Preferences window
	<dd><a href="prefs.glade">prefs.glade</a></dd>
	<dd><a href="prefs.e">prefs.e</a></dd></li> 
<li>The main 'driver' program
	<dd><a href="namespace_demo.ex">namespace_demo.ex</a></dd></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> namespace_demo.ex should be run from an x-term!

<p>
Doesn't look so simple now, does it?
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, this is in fact a good way to structure very complex programs,
so that you can locate and modify things without searching through page after
page of code.
</p>

<p>
In addition, working in this 'modular' way also makes it less likely you will 
completely ruin your program by clicking the wrong thing in the Glade
designer. Trust me, it's easy to do.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is generally a good idea to name the files similarly: e.g. 
about.glade and about.e. This makes namespacing simpler. Also, note 
how simple and clean the code is in each of these <i>*.e</i> modules!
</p>

<p>
There's a possible drawback to this scheme, in that all the functions called from Glade must
be declared as <i>global</i>.
