<h2>Using Glade</h2>

<img src="../screenshots/x3.png" alt="glade" align="right" width="400" />

<h3>Linking more functions</h3>
<h4>Opening a file</h4>

<p>
Use Glade to select the File-&gt;Open menu item, which will be named <i>imagemenuitem2</i>, unless you've changed it.<br /><br />
<i><small><em>(Note that you are free to change the name of any item by typing a new name 
into the ID: entry on the General tab for that item.)</small></i>
</em></p>

<p>
Let's do so, and change <i>imagemenuitem2</i> to a more meaningful name: <i>file_open</i> 
(as usual, no quotes). 
</p>

<p>
Now select the Signals tab, and set the  <i>activate</i> handler to be <i>open_file</i>. This will
be the name of your Euphoria function which will, surprise, surprise! - open a file!
</p>

<p>Click the Save the Current Project toolbutton, and run your program again. 
In your terminal you should see something resembling:
<div class="scrn"><tt><pre>
-------------------------------------------------
-- Undeclared function in test1.glade
-------------------------------------------------

------------------------------
global function open_file() 
------------------------------

return 1
end function
</pre></tt></div>

<p>
Copy the function template from the terminal, paste it into your Eu program, 
and fill in the blank space with some working code, as shown in the code sample below.
</p>

<p>Since you will be using EuGTK's handy pre-built <i>fileselector</i>, you'll also have to add <tt><em class="kw">include</em> GtkFileSelector.e</tt> to the top of your program.
</p>

<div class="quote"></p><tt><pre>
<em class="kw">include</em> GtkEngine.e
<em class="kw">include</em> GtkFileSelector.e <em>-- add this</em>

<em class="gtk">add</em>(builder,<em class="str">"~/demos/examples/glade/test1.glade"</em>)

<em class="gtk">main</em>()

<em>---------------------------</em>
<em class="kw"><b>global</b> function</em> help_me() 
<em>---------------------------</em>
<em class="kw">return</em> <em class="gtk">Info</em>(,,<em class="str">"About","My fine program!"</em>)
<em class="kw">end function</em>

<em>----------------------------</em>
<em class="kw"><b>global</b> function</em> open_file() 
<em>----------------------------</em>
<em class="kw">object</em> fname = fileselector:Open(<em class="str">"*.ex"</em>) <em>-- use the handy pre-build selector</em>
<em class="kw">if sequence</em>(fname) <em class="kw">then</em>
	<em class="gtk">Info</em>(,,<em class="str">"You Selected"</em>,fname)
<em class="kw">end if</em>
<em class="kw">return</em> 1
<em class="kw">end function</em>
</pre></tt>
</div>

<p>
Click on a file, and you should see the filename displayed in
a neat pop-up box.
</p>

<h3>Adding Widgets</h3>
<h4>Containers</h4>

<p>
If you recall, the original Box <img class="x" src="../thumbnails/grn_star.png" alt="green star" height="15px;" /> we added as the first item in our window had 
3 'divisions', oriented vertically. We filled the first (top) with a menu, and the 3rd (bottom) with 
a button. The middle one was left empty, and so it doesn't show at all.
</p>

<p>Let's add some things to the middle.
We can't put more than one item in there; try it, you'll see.
</p>

<p>
We'll need a container if we want more than one thing there, so choose another
Box <img class="x" src="../thumbnails/grn_star.png" alt="green star" height="15px;" />, 
drop it into the empty middle space, change number of items to 2, and click create.
The default orientation is vertical, which won't do for this particular demo, so change it 
to horizontal.
</p>

<p>
Into the left-hand panel of the Box we just added, drop an image container. It's the little house with the yellow roof in the Control and Display section of the left-hand toolbar.
</p>

<p>
In the right-hand panel, drop a label container. It's also in the Control and Display section. Under Appearance/Label: type in some text. Use markup if you like, and click the Use Markup checkbox.
Save your work - you should do this frequently.
</p>

<img src="../screenshots/test5.png" alt="test5" align="right" />

<p>
What about the image? 
We'll need to pick one, so click on the little missing image 
icon on your program's window, and choose one of the following:
<ul>
	<li>A stock id from the drop-down combo</li>
	<li>An icon name<dd>face-cool, for example</dd></li>
	<li>A file 
		<dd>Choose one from the file selector on the right.</dd>
		</li>
		
		<ul>
		<small>

		<li>
		You could, in the Glade Image..Filename box, type in the full path
		to the file: e.g. /home/irv/demos/thumbnails/mongoose.png,
		but that might be incorrect if a different user uses your program. 
		</li>
		
		<li>
		You could put the image(s) in the same folder as your program,
		then in your code, do a chdir() to the current program folder: chdir(prog_dir).
		This way, you can keep your program and related images in their own private
		space, and they can be moved to another folder without getting lost.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		You might put the images in the user's home folder, in which case they
		could be found with no special effort, but it would be
		impolite to clutter up someone's personal space.
		</li>
		
		</small>
		</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Run the program again, and note that no changes or additions or adjustments were required to the 12 lines of Euphoria source code.
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Suppose we want an image more pleasing than the one above?
Just change the open_file function a bit:
</p>

<p>
<div class="quote"><pre><code> <em>-----------------------------</em>
<em class="kw"><b> global</b> function</em> open_file() 
<em> -----------------------------</em>
<em class="gtk"> fileselector:filters</em> = {<em class="str">"image"</em>}
<em class="kw" > object</em> newfile = <em class="gtk">fileselector:Open</em>(<em class="str">"*"</em>)
<em class="kw"> if sequence</em>(newfile) <em class="kw">then</em>
  <em class="gtk"> set</em>(<em class="str">"image1","from file"</em>,newfile)
<em class="kw"> end if</em>
<em class="kw"> return</em> 1
<em class="kw"> end function</em>
</code></pre></div>
</p>

<p>
Just click on the image you prefer. I like this one!
</p>

<img src="../screenshots/test6.png" alt="Calendar" align="right" width="500px" />

<br clear="all" />

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Building more complex objects such as TreeViews, ListViews, etc. with Glade will involve some experimenting. 
Explaining these in detail (using words) would require a whole book, which, like most such 
books, would cost $99.00 plus tax, and would bore you half to death.
</p>

<p>
So, if you really feel that you can't handle it on your own from here, start saving your $99.00 (plus tax) for the book. 
</p>

<p>But frankly, Glade doesn't save any time when creating these objects, since the process is very tedious. You can achieve the same outcome
much more easily by writing just a few lines of code with an ordinary text editor, cutting and pasting from the demo programs where applicable.
</p>

<p> 
Try it - this isn't rocket surgery!
